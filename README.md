# StudySlap
texts all your friends that you're not studying when you're supposed to be

minimum viable product:
- set up discord bot
- chrome extension frontend w/ toggle
- determines if tabs are relevant w/ gpt
- texts all your friends
- dims your tab if it's off task (and makes the tab unresponsive + unusable)

polish:
- prettify frontend
- add more off-task messages
- other message ideas include images of you (e.g. wanted poster, mentions what you're doing)
- counts how many times you've switched per session
- "streak" which continues the longer the extension is on (prevents you from just switching it off)
